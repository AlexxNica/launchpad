## ‚öñÔ∏è Launchpad Principles
Feedback is a gift. Please give your feedback on the program and how we can make it better! If someone gives you feedback, it's because they‚Äôre trying to help you improve ‚Äî but understand there are often many ways to do something, so give feedback with curiosity and an open mind.
Improve as we go. Related to the above, when you spot areas of improvement for the program, we want to capture them along the journey rather than hoping to remember them at the end. A retro will happen at the end, but please also post in #pl-bootcamp-v0 as you see things. Including an emoji like ü§î can make it easier to harvest these thoughts for the retro.
Be respectful. This whole program falls under the IPFS Code of Conduct. Always be kind and welcoming.
Collaboration. Be proactively helpful to everyone you can. Answer questions, offer ideas, share your work and learnings - try to give back to the community and others who are helping you! Understand that many great ideas can blossom in parallel - avoid being competitive, secretive, or ego-ful about your work or ideas.
Async first. We bias toward async comms to support many time zones and schedules. Try to use slack threads, record meetings, and document your questions/learnings so others can benefit. More here.
Transparency. To promote a good OSS environment, we try to make our work open to all - even before we‚Äôre ready. Please try to use group channels to post your questions instead of DMs (where others can‚Äôt learn from you), and share your answers in public forums wherever possible (ex discourse, Filecoin slack, etc).
