## Web3 & IPFS

### What is Web3?

[This article gives a great summary](https://medium.com/@vegxcodes/what-you-should-know-about-web3-part-1-15a2ddcfbc41) of the first three stages of Web evolution.

**Web 1 - Shared Information**

Web1 was a worldwide network of static website, on which any users could basically view and share pages of information, with little interaction.

**Web 2 - Shared Creation**

Web2 is a version of the internet where users are able to easily create and post their own content, though how decisions are made, who owns the data, and the ways (and to whom) content is shared is ruled by a few, large, technological gateholders.

**Web 3 - Shared Hosting**

Web3 is an internet that shares and distributes the processesing and decision making necessary for the internet, where the users have sovereign control over their data. Web 3 is a distributed, decentralized version of the internet.
