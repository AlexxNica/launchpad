## Web3 & IPFS

### What is Web3?

Once we have fully transitioned to web3, developers will no longer build and deploy applications that run on a single server or that store their data in a single database (hosted and managed by a single cloud service provider).

Web3 applications will run on blockchains and decentralized networks of many peer to peer nodes, using a different set of protocols, including cryptoeconomic protocols referred to as DeFi (decentralized finance). The apps built on web3 are known as DApps (decentralized apps).

**Web 1 - Shared Information**

Web1 was a worldwide network of static website, on which any users could basically view and share pages of information, with little interaction.

**Web 2 - Shared Creation**

Web2 is a version of the internet where users are able to easily create and post their own content, though how decisions are made, who owns the data, and the ways (and to whom) content is shared is ruled by a few, large, technological gateholders.

**Web 3 - Shared Hosting**

Web3 is an internet that shares and distributes the processesing and decision making necessary for the internet, where the users have sovereign control over their data. Web3 is a distributed, decentralized version of the internet.

### IPFS

IPFS was the core (first) project in the Protocol Labs Network, from which other projects and technologies have grown. Protocol Labs was formed by Juan Benet in May 2014 to support fundamental research, development, and deployment of infrastructure for open networks (like the internet), with IPFS and its complementary incentivization layer, Filecoin, as the first projects.
