## Drand
DRand is a distributed, bias-resistant, unpredictable, and publicly verifiable randomness generator that is key to the Filecoin implementation in how it provides unpredictable, decentralized and publicly verifiable random values for the blockchain. [Learn more about how Drand works in the docs](https://drand.love/docs/overview/#how-drand-works)

Drand uses [cryptographic methods](https://drand.love/docs/cryptography/#setup-phase), collective public keys, and a private key share of a collective private key to generate randomness in a distributed manner
