### Drand
DRand is a distributed, bias-resistant, unpredictable and publicly verifiable randomness generator that is key to the Filecoin implementation in how it provides unpredictable, decentralized and publicly verifiable random values for the blockchain.

Drand uses [cryptographic methods](https://drand.love/docs/cryptography/#setup-phase), collective public keys, and a private key share of a collective private key to generate randomness in a distributed manner
