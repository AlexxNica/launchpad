# Filecoin

**Filecoin in the incentivation structure** for IPFS.

The mission of **Filecoin** is to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity’s information.

Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files, with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time. In other words, Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that provides data persistence via a decentralized protocol, and publicly verifiable storage proofs on a blockchain.

In Filecoin, users pay to store their files on storage providers. Storage providers are computers responsible for storing files and proving they have stored the files correctly over time. Anyone who wants to store their files or get paid for storing other users’ files can join Filecoin.

Available storage, and the price of that storage, is not controlled by any single company. Instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files that anyone can participate in.

_Filecoin is a data storage and retrieval marketplace that coordinates untrusted parties to buy and sell provable storage._
