## The Ecosystem

<!-- Need a summary paragraph -->

**[The Ecosystem Directory](https://ecosystem.ipfs.io/)**

Use the filters on the ecosystem directory page to explore projects by what they do, the industry, and which tooling (such as IPFS, FIlecoin, go-ipfs) to better understand what makes up the ecosystem.

## Brave

IPFS has been integrated into Brave, the fast, privacy-oriented browser, reinventing the Web for users, publishers and advertisers.
