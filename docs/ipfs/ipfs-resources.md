## JS-IPFS Examples
_The full example can be found [in the ipfs-examples repo](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/js-ipfs-examples)_

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

#### Installation

1. Install yarn globally (needed to resolve dependencies correctly when working in a monorepo)
   ```sh
   npm install -g yarn
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Run all the examples
   ```sh
   yarn run test
   ```
