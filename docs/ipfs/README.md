# IPFS

## What is IPFS
 **IPFS** stands for **I**nter**P**lanetary **F**ile **S**ystem.

IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. Read more about how this works [in the docs](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/).

IPFS aims to [decentralize the web](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/#decentralization) and connects people to information using [content addressing](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/#content-addressing) instead of URLs and servers.

The mission of **IPFS** is to create a resilient, upgradable, open network to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge.

## Why IPFS?

The acceleration of innovation over the past few decades, in comparison with the past million years of human evolution, is moving at an incredible pace.

IPFS as an organization is trying to look ahead to the next 10, 100, 1000 years and beyond and think about how computing will shape and impact a future we can't even being to imagine.

Though it gets difficult to predict what is going to happen in the next, say, 100 years, we can start to invest in it now with web3.


Computation has gone through so many phases; from the first computers, to machines that can timeshare, to multiprocessing and sandboxed VMs, to user terminals, to networked computers with multiprocessing, now with personal computers networked across a worldwide internet that all came from a relatively simple set of functions and data transmission. Now, IPFS is on the front lines of the Web3 evolution the will bring us to the next stage in computing.

### Tutorials
For those who are newer to the world of Filecoin, Web3, and storage verification, check out the [Protoschool tutorials](https://proto.school/course/ipfs). Tutorials you should complete include:

* [Content Addressing on the Decentralized Web](https://proto.school/content-addressing)
* [Mutable File System](https://proto.school/mutable-file-system)
* [Regular Files API](https://proto.school/regular-files-api) (read only)

#### Getting Started with IPFS
This video is the basic setup for ipfs-go on a [linux VM](https://multipass.run/), using [wget](https://www.tecmint.com/install-wget-in-linux/) to grab the resources. You will also `ipfs init` a node and get it running with `ipfs daemon`.

#### Resources
* [Installation Instructions](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/command-line/#system-requirements)
* When you run `ipfs daemon`, if you get the error: `lock <path>/.ipfs/repo.lock: someone else has the lock`, run the command `killall ipfs` and try again


#### IPFS Basics: Accessing Files
In this tutorial, you can follow along to understand the basics of how you as a user can access, add, and pin files in IPFS.  Follow along  with the examples to learn about pinning and adding files, how files from IPFS can be previewed and inspected, and learn a bit about how that data is created and stored on IPFS.
