## External Facing Teams
### Ecosystem
The ecosystem team at Protocol Labs focuses on the wider community including efforts involving hackathons, grants, collabs & accelerators, browsers & special projects, growth & client solutions, the Filcoin community, and any other efforts to support and grow the ecosystem of technology built for web3.

### Research and Grants

Within Protocol Labs, it is the role of Research to lead idea generation and testing, roadmapping, knowledge sharing, and research collaborations. Additionally, researchers set the tone of technological optimism, sharing with others the belief that scientific or engineering tools can help solve some of the biggest problems facing humanity, and that addressing these problems, indirectly or directly, is the most important work to be done. We also tackle more broadly scoped questions.
