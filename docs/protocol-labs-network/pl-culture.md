# Where does this title go?

## Protocol Labs Culture

Protocol Labs is building the next generation of the internet. We are an open-source R&D lab that builds protocols, tools, and services to radically improve the internet. Our products serve thousands of organizations and millions of people.

We are a fully distributed company that relies on our network to drive innovation forward, and there a set of open source practices we follow in order to grow and flourish in the open source world. This distributed, open source philosophy is at the core of how was operate as an organization.


We also believe in connection, and bringing people together to inspire innovation

## External Facing Teams
### Ecosystem
The ecosystem team at Protocol Labs focuses on the wider community including efforts involving hackathons, grants, collabs & accelerators, browsers & special projects, growth & client solutions, the Filcoin community, and any other efforts to support and grow the ecosystem of technology built for web3.

### Research and Grants

Within Protocol Labs, it is the role of Research to lead idea generation and testing, roadmapping, knowledge sharing, and research collaborations. Additionally, researchers set the tone of technological optimism, sharing with others the belief that scientific or engineering tools can help solve some of the biggest problems facing humanity, and that addressing these problems, indirectly or directly, is the most important work to be done. We also tackle more broadly scoped questions.

### Async Work

By default, our approach to communication is async.

Open async communication enables greater participation, keeps low-priority matters from interrupting high-priority work, and typically leaves a better paper trail. This is not just about accommodating our global team, it’s also about ensuring that we get the most leverage from our communities.

Async communication can take more time, but we believe it can enable better thinking, as well as technical outcomes for networks, systems and processes. These practices are what allow us to scale as an org.
Though we aim for async comms, sync time is also valuable for bringing multiple parties into agreement, focused problem-solving sessions, and early-stage project formation. Sync time, or synchronous communication, is widely recognized to be face to face conversations, or phone and video communications.

We strive to avoid using sync time as the hammer to solve any question. When we do meet synchronously, we attempt to propagate the outcomes of that sync time (by documenting discussions, decisions, etc.) to other teams.
Async communication might sometimes feel like a chore, or a bit overzealous, but in time, this approach to comms builds momentum and enable us to:
* Build and maintain documentation
* Avoid many miscommunications
* Reduce our bus factor
* Make the switch from proprietary to open-source far smoother

If you are unfamiliar with approaches to software development, there are several out there, but one in particular hits some of the same goals we share. The Async Manifesto, while not a perfect solution, is a short read, and worth your time.
