# Open Source Culture

## Communication at Protocol Labs
_[See the complete information about how Protocol Labs communicates in Spaceport](https://protocol.almanac.io/docs/communication-t5gNj2sm6jShmc8ZGmGxvmB9Iw1WNCCU)_

In our mission to drive breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward, we welcome and listen to every voice. Humanity, after all, is composed of all humans, and learning from each other is key.

To ensure these conversations remain constructive and safe for all, we have developed guidelines for participation:

* We are kind and respectful. We do not insult, or disparage and We ask questions, seeking clarification, assuming we don't know the full story We communicate in good faith, meaning that we don‚Äôt provoke people intentionally. We help one another grow and assume that we have the best intent.

* We are allies. We stand up for one another. We build the culture and environment we want to see. So, when we see something we say something.

### More on How to Interact

Discord, Email, and Zoom are our workplace: in interacting with other Labbers, remember that they are your collaborators and peers.

* Written communication lacks important cues we typically get when speaking to others in person
* Written communication is long-lasting: remember that written communication lasts longer than verbal communications so others will come back to it time and time again.
* Mind the audience: in communicating with others, pause and think about who your message is intended for and whether the medium is appropriate.


## Protocol Labs: An Open Source Organization

Working at Protocol Labs (PL) is a fairly unique experience. For most Labbers, the majority of your work will be on open source projects. IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin, Multiformats, IPLD, and others are all projects that we sponsor (and that we have created, though that‚Äôs not a requirement for our sponsorship). Each of these projects is an independent open source project, and each of them has needs and goals independent of Protocol Labs.

## Managing Roles

The tricky part here is being an employee of PL, and a member of a project with its own independent goals, is not conflating the two in a way that is harmful to the community. Talking about PL specific endeavors, internal meetings, and events in public repositories or issues can make community members feel left out, and uninvited.

One way to think about it, is to think of yourself as two people, or one person, but with two hats.  When you are wearing that libp2p hat, you are not an employee of Protocol Labs, you are instead an open source contributor to libp2p. While wearing this hat, you are looking out for this project‚Äôs best interests, independent of what your PL obligations are.


## Async Work & Communication
_This is an annotated verson of [this Spaceport article](https://protocol.almanac.io/docs/async-work-ezPny9x7Q50QISL4UIUhB3PoURV0lgxP)_

 Open async communication enables greater participation, keeps low-priority matters from interrupting high-priority work, and typically leaves a better paper trail.

Though we aim for async comms, **sync time is also valuable for bringing multiple parties into agreement, focused problem-solving sessions, and early-stage project formation**. Sync time, or synchronous communication, is widely recognized to be face to face conversations, or phone and video communications.

In time, this approach to comms builds momentum and enable us to:

* Build and maintain documentation
* Avoid many miscommunications
* Reduce our bus factor‚Äã
* Make the switch from proprietary to open-source far smoother

**[The Async Manifesto](http://asyncmanifesto.org/)**, spells out many of these principles. Pay particular attention to are as follows:

* Valuing modern tools and flexible work environments over meetings and office hours
* Embracing flexibility in prioritization over detailed planning
* Creating comprehensive documentation over tribal knowledge


A high-bandwidth bidirectional communication channel is needed, either for brainstorming or decision making, where all relevant and interested parties can be gathered.

Relevant required readings are distributed in advance

### Async Communication Is Self Directing

Our goal is to have resources and processes that allow you, as an individual, to feel empowered to find all the answers to the questions you might have. With that said, here are some guidelines for helping you find what you‚Äôre looking for.

* Can‚Äôt find the doc? Have you read the main resource? Have you done a thorough search of all resources? Well then, you are really out of luck, BUT! you are probably not alone. Instead of pinging someone, consider it a bug, open an issue on GitHub, and let others answer it asynchronously.

* Need to get an answer to something?
  * Is it urgent? No? send an email.
  * Does it have to happen in the next 30 minutes? Yes, then ping the person or team on the channel of the respective work stream, not in a DM. It enables others to pick up an urgent item in case the main person is not available.

* If you know that the person is busy, then consider providing hints on how urgent the email is on the subject (i.e., **P0 to P4**). Also, be okay with writing emails that are one sentence long. Courtesy over conciseness can cost someone time.

Need something done? Create a GitHub issue, do the footwork of getting it to ‚Äúready‚Äù state, and assign it to someone.

Ideally, you‚Äôll be able to add it to a team‚Äôs kanban board and make sure the team members know about it to make sure it will be covered in some team‚Äôs regular check-ins.

Need a decision made? Either open an issue or a pull request (PR) on GitHub. Make sure to identify key stakeholders and set a deadline for discussion/decision.


### Components of a Great Async Message

The 4 components of a great asynchronous message

üó£ Enough information to cover all follow-up questions. Don‚Äôt let yourself be the victim of an open loop; over-communicate if necessary.

üìÖ A deadline. When do you need a response by? How urgent is it? Which task is being blocked right now?

üîó Links, images, and as much supporting material as possible. Again, include screenshots, screencasts, images, etc. ‚Äì whatever will help illustrate your thoughts. Add these to emails, GitHub comments, posts, etc.

üì• A concrete need. What do you want to get out of the communication? Approval on a task? An asset of some kind? Be extremely clear.
