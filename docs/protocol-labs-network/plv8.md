# Transitioning from Version 7 to 8
Version 7 of Protocol Labs typically was referred to as a company that operated with a lot of internal facing communications and processes. Although there was a great deal of OSS and collaborative work being done, there was a stark difference between the core PL teams, and the other teams in the ecosystem.

Protocol Labs exists to enable a network of projects, tools, startups, communities (and more) that are springing up and evolving around the protocols being developed. As this ecosystem grows, these projects invest in the network itself, and the network grows along with it, which in turn benefits and incentivizes this ongoing evolution.
