description: Protocol Labs Organization â€“ Version 8
---

Protocol Labs exists to enable a network of projects, tools, startups, research, communities (and more) that are springing up and evolving around the protocols being developed. As this ecosystem grows, these projects invest in the network itself, and the network grows along with it, which in turn benefits and incentivizes this ongoing evolution.

The mission of the Ecosystem effort is to seed the long-term growth of the decentralized web, by cultivating a wide variety of developers and stakeholders, aligning them with the success of our protocols, and treating them like gold.
