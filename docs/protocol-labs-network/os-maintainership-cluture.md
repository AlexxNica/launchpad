# Open Source Maintainership and Culture

## Protocol Labs: An Open Source Organization

Working at Protocol Labs (PL) is a fairly unique experience. For most Labbers, the majority of your work will be on open source projects. IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin, Multiformats, IPLD, and others are all projects that we sponsor (and that we have created, though that’s not a requirement for our sponsorship). Each of these projects is an independent open source project, and each of them has needs and goals independent of Protocol Labs.


## Managing Roles

The tricky part here is being an employee of PL, and a member of a project with its own independent goals, is not conflating the two in a way that is harmful to the community. Talking about PL specific endeavors, internal meetings, and events in public repositories or issues can make community members feel left out, and uninvited.

One way to think about it, is to think of yourself as two people, or one person, but with two hats. One hat has a big PL logo, and is the one you wear when you are thinking about Protocol Labs and its priorities. The other hat is the one with the logo of the open source project (libp2p, for example) on it. When you are wearing that libp2p hat, you are not an employee of Protocol Labs, you are instead an open source contributor to libp2p. While wearing this hat, you are looking out for this project’s best interests, independent of what your PL obligations are.


## Async Work & Communication
_This is an annotated verson of [this Spaceport article](https://protocol.almanac.io/docs/async-work-ezPny9x7Q50QISL4UIUhB3PoURV0lgxP)_

 Open async communication enables greater participation, keeps low-priority matters from interrupting high-priority work, and typically leaves a better paper trail.

Async communication can take more time, but we believe it can enable better thinking, as well as technical outcomes for networks, systems and processes. These practices are what allow us to scale as an network.

Though we aim for async comms, sync time is also valuable for bringing multiple parties into agreement, focused problem-solving sessions, and early-stage project formation. Sync time, or synchronous communication, is widely recognized to be face to face conversations, or phone and video communications.

In time, this approach to comms builds momentum and enable us to:

* Build and maintain documentation
* Avoid many miscommunications
* Reduce our bus factor​
* Make the switch from proprietary to open-source far smoother

**[The Async Manifesto](http://asyncmanifesto.org/)**, spells out many of these principles. Pay particular attention to are as follows:

* Valuing modern tools and flexible work environments over meetings and office hours
* Embracing flexibility in prioritization over detailed planning
* Creating comprehensive documentation over tribal knowledge


A high-bandwidth bidirectional communication channel is needed, either for brainstorming or decision making, where all relevant and interested parties can be gathered.

Relevant required readings are distributed in advance

While we are decidedly and async-first network, we recognize the power and importance of synchronous communication, and support escalating from email to calls to in-person time when necessary to reach consensus and undo misunderstandings (that's why we have Office hours).

### Async Communication Is Self Directing

Our goal is to have resources and processes that allow you, as an individual, to feel empowered to find all the answers to the questions you might have. We try to avoid interrupting each other as much as possible, but sometimes it helps to have a little nudge in the right direction. With that said, here are some guidelines for helping you find what you’re looking for.

* Can’t find the doc? Have you read the main resource? Have you done a Handbook Search, Google Docs Search, and a GitHub Search? Well then, you are really out of luck, BUT! you are probably not alone. Instead of pinging someone, consider it a bug, open an issue on GitHub, and let others answer it asynchronously.

* Need to get an answer to something? Is it urgent? No -> (async) send email, yes? Does it have to happen in the next 30 minutes? No -> (async) send email? Yes -> (broadcast) Ping the person or team on the channel of the respective work stream, not in a DM. It enables others to pick up an urgent item in case the main person is not available.

* If you know that the person is busy, then consider providing hints on how urgent the email is on the subject (i.e., **P0 to P4**). Also, be okay with writing emails that are one sentence long. Courtesy over conciseness can cost someone time.

Need something done? Create a GitHub issue, do the footwork of getting it to “ready” state, and assign it to someone.
Ideally, you’ll be able to add it to a team’s kanban board and make sure the team members know about it to make sure it will be covered in some team’s regular check-ins. If that team isn’t regularly checking in with their GitHub issues, encourage them to be more proactive about managing themselves as a team using transparent asynchronous tools.

Need a decision made? Either open an issue or a pull request (PR) on GitHub. Make sure to identify key stakeholders and set a deadline for discussion/decision.

Notice a pattern? A question that keeps getting answered over and over? Suggest it as a handbook entry.

#### Components of a Great Async Message

The 4 components of a great asynchronous message

🗣 Enough information to cover all follow-up questions. Don’t let yourself be the victim of an open loop; over-communicate if necessary.

📅 A deadline. When do you need a response by? How urgent is it? Which task is being blocked right now?

🔗 Links, images, and as much supporting material as possible. Again, include screenshots, screencasts, images, etc. – whatever will help illustrate your thoughts. Add these to emails, GitHub comments, posts, etc.

📥 A concrete need. What do you want to get out of the communication? Approval on a task? An asset of some kind? Be extremely clear.
