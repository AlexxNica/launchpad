# Open Source Maintainership and Culture

## Protocol Labs: An Open Source Organization

Working at Protocol Labs (PL) is a fairly unique experience. For most Labbers, the majority of your work will be on open source projects. IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin, Multiformats, IPLD, and others are all projects that we sponsor (and that we have created, though that’s not a requirement for our sponsorship). Each of these projects is an independent open source project, and each of them has needs and goals independent of Protocol Labs.


## Managing Roles

The tricky part here is being an employee of PL, and a member of a project with its own independent goals, is not conflating the two in a way that is harmful to the community. Talking about PL specific endeavors, internal meetings, and events in public repositories or issues can make community members feel left out, and uninvited.

One way to think about it, is to think of yourself as two people, or one person, but with two hats. One hat has a big PL logo, and is the one you wear when you are thinking about Protocol Labs and its priorities. The other hat is the one with the logo of the open source project (libp2p, for example) on it. When you are wearing that libp2p hat, you are not an employee of Protocol Labs, you are instead an open source contributor to libp2p. While wearing this hat, you are looking out for this project’s best interests, independent of what your PL obligations are.
